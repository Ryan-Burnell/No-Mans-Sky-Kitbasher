This is a Prelimary Investigation into the No Man's Sky spacecraft, how they are defined in the game files and how they are shown in-game

Upon inspection of the game files, with the software No Man's Sky Model Viewer, I am able to open every model in the game files, going back to the E3 2015 Demo (Sidenote that last bit is basically irrelevant but I just care about anything after release)


This isn't really within the scope of my current aims, but I can also view multitools as well which is definitely interesting, this is something that I will have to look into further.

A Prelimary investigation reveals that the spacecraft are categoried first by role, and then the parts are categorised by what they are, for example;

-Cockpit
-Cockpit Neck
-Landing Gear
-Wings
-Engines

Further from this they are then numerated by the alphabet, so A, B, C and so on.

However this means that it is very tricky to search through the list, as there is no filtering and there is only a search box. Although I reckon I might be able to throw something together in Excel that might work. Although it would be a bit tricky and I don't have enough caffeine in me to work it out.

Alongside this there are several cockpit *interiors* that are included in the list, which makes things interesting.




[Further investigation of the full fighters does indicate that there is a rendered space beneath the canopy, which I will have to tweak before I attempt a print.]

Further analysis indicates that I could potentially kitbash together my own ships, but again, I am nowhere near caffeinated enough to work it out.

I've had a *major* breakthrough regarding my categorising of these models, yes there are some discrepancies between the website I have found and the model names which is definitely weird, [On a sidenote, this name discrepancy doesn't really matter too much, but its something I can work with] but its a start and I can do a process of elimination which works in my favour... This is a ship customiser generation website that has every procedural combination for a ship, down to every part. The website in question being *https://nms.center/*

The only question now that remains is how to categorise the parts, because even with this website, its still going to be a timeconsuming task to go through each and every part to run cross-referencing.

I believe I have come up with a solution, cross-referencing the names with the parts, and inputting that data into a spreadsheet... Lets get to work.

I have run another test ship through the printer, and I am now settling on the scale I want for the ships.

Time flew by, but we're back in business, I am now going to attempt to categorise each ship part that I can by classification, purely by letter increments to distinguish them, after which I will cross-refererence the names. Here we go
